Most of these scripts assume the AWS CLI is installed and jq

See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html for instructions

See http://stedolan.github.io/jq/                                                                                                                                                                    

On ubuntu 14.04 you can install jq with
