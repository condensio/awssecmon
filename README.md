The purpose of these Python and shell scripts is to provide examples of AWS usage as well as save you time to troubleshooting.

Most of these scripts assume the following environment variables have been defined.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="xxx"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

Adjust your region as necessary
